# REST-data-application

This application is about the backend communication. The user generates some random data on the browser page. The bubbles with the random numbers can be dragged and dropped inside the groups. This data is sent to the server where it is passed to an algorithm which processes it and saves it on the server in a JSON file. When requested, the data of this JSON is sent back to the client and at the same time saved in MongoDB.
